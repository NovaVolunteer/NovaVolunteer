## Brian Wright

I'm the Quantitative Foundation Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Programs at the School of Data Science at UVA. I've been teaching and developing Data Science programs since 2012 and am (hopefully) widely recognized as a leader and innovator in Data Science education.

In my current role, I led the development of UVA’s Minor and Major in Data Science and am the Director of the Collaboratory for the Advancement of Data Science and Education, a wide-reaching partnership with UVA’s School of Education. I also oversees The Data Science Active Learning Lab, an applied research lab focused on creating effective and innovative pedagogical methods for Data Science education.
