## Brian Wright,👋

I'm the Quantitative Foundation Associate Professor and Director of Undergraduate Programs at the School of Data Science at UVA. I've been teaching and developing Data Science programs since 2012 and am (hopefully) widely recognized as a leader and innovator in Data Science education.

In terms of research, my focus is on the intersection between Data Science and Education. My lab is The Data Science Active Learning Lab, an applied research lab focused on creating effective and innovative pedagogical methods for Data Science education. Check out our website [Active Learning Lab](https://dsactivelearninglab.com/)

I also have my own company DSLabs, LLC that focuses on connecting faculty with private sector companies to aid in early stage R&D efforts, mostly in the defense sector. (I worked for the DoD for about a decade) The company page is here: [DS Labs](https://datasciencelabsllc.com/)
